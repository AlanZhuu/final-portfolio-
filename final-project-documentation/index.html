                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The two worlds are connected together through a mobile device. In the last two weeks of the semester I started to use and understand more about the functions and interaction of AR, and then I started to think about the idea of using AR technology to create the Final Project. At the beginning of the proposal I was planning to create a secret room with motion capture for AR interaction. Unity is primarily a game engine, but can also be used to create AR applications easily. It offers a wealth of 3D modelling and animation tools, and it is also possible to write custom AR logic code in C# or JavaScript in Unity.

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>AR technical effects on unity I also needed to implant vuforia, which provides image recognition, tracking and augmented reality for AR implementation. ar Foundation, a plug-in for Unity, provides a set of cross-platform AR features, including plane detection, depth perception and facial recognition etc..</p>
                <p>I found some technical video bloggers who could render such effects as a study and reference. I found that I needed to install another plugin for unity called manomotion. I also imported objects created by other 3D modelling software, such as Blender.
                </p>

                <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->
                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-third">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/model phoenxi.png"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/testing.mov"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/testing2.mov"/>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Based on the existing model of the chamber environment, I was reminded of the How to Train Your Dragon animation. So I decided to incorporate the dragon element into the chamber environment. Then a function was set up to trigger the appearance of the dragon through specific pictures. </p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>  It is satisfying to know that although the process was difficult and challenging, I also got results from learning to use unity that will help me in preparing and expanding my final project. I feel that I am satisfied with the presentation of this work in that I have independently animated a virtual target, learnt to use a new skill and implemented AR effects.
