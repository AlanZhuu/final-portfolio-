                <h1>Alan YingchengZhu</h1>
                <p>Studying computational art has allowed me to explore the intersection of art and technology, and to find new ways to create works that are both visually striking and intellectually engaging. By combining traditional artistic techniques with cutting-edge software and hardware is 

                    one of the things that excites me most about computational art is the way it allows me to collaborate with others in new and exciting ways. Whether I am working with programmers, designers, or other artists, I am constantly learning from my peers and discovering new ways to approach my work.
